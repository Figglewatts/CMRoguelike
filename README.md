# CMRoguelike

A Roguelike made in 42 hours (originally) for Chelmsford Makerspace's CMJam. See: <a href="http://gamejam.cmspace.org">gamejam.cmspace.org</a>.
I'm now updating it regularly to make it into a fully-fledged Roguelike.

### Quickstart

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the repo to your computer
3. Open "deps.zip" and extract it to the root directory of the repo
4. Open each folder (CMJamGame, CMJamGame-android, CMJamGame-desktop) as a new project in any Java IDE. I'd recommend Eclipse.
5. When you compile and run, make sure you run CMJamGame-desktop, or else it won't run at all. Don't blame me, blame LibGDX.

Have fun!
